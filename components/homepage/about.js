            I graduated from Erciyes University with a degree in Tourism Guiding
            and have been leading tours in English and Brazilian Portuguese.
            Gaming has always been a great hobby of mine and I aspired to work
            with the developers whose works I admired. I didn't have any
            programming knowledge so I decided to use my English skills.

            After deciding to actively participate in the gaming industry, I
            joined forces with a group with whom we localized two great games,
            ES:Skyrim and Mass Effect 3. These fan translations of two well
            known titles gave me the experience I needed to start working on a
            more professional level.

            Since my participation in those fan translations, I have worked on
            multiple titles on platforms like PC, mobile and Xbox. In order to
            reach these developers, I visited important gaming conventions such
            as Gamescom and GamingIstanbul in a professional capacity to
            introduce myself and the company I was working with.

            Recently, I have taken great interest in programming languages such
            as C# and Javascript. To further my involvement with programming, I
            decided to study Computer Programming in Dokuz Eyl√ºl University
            located in Izmir, Turkey. I'm currently on the lookout for new
            opportunities to learn more about programming.
